                   <p>Hi, I'm Joe. I&#39;ve been gazing at maps and playing around with computers for as long as I can remember and I&#39;ve been doing it for a living since 2010. I believe that maps and the web can help us make sense of the huge volume of data out there and begin to understand the world around us.</p>
                   <p>I'm a consultant at <a href="http://www.forteconsulting.ca/">Forte Consulting</a> in Victoria, BC. I previously worked as a GIS Developer at <a href="http://www.wspgroup.com/en/WSP-UK/" >WSP Group</a>, a multidisciplinary engineering company in the UK.</p>
                   <p>Recently I worked on the design, development and data management of the <a href="http://joeburkinshaw.com/vicrecyclingmaps/" >Victoria Recycling Maps</a> project, with <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brucemackenzieca" >Bruce Mackenzie</a>.</p>
                   <p>I love the outdoors and spend my time exploring Vancouver Island by foot, mountain bike and kayak. When I&#39;m home I like to map the places I&#39;ve spent time getting to know by editing <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/49.89158/-125.65236"  >OpenStreetMap</a>. Occasionally I map <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/30601841"  >places in need</a> of <a href="http://hotosm.org/"  >humanitarian</a> relief that I haven&#39;t visited before.</p>
                   <p>I&#39;m a firm believer in open data and open source software. I try to <a href="https://github.com/JBurkinshaw"  >contribute and utilize</a> it when I can. I stopped using Windows at home in 2010 in favour of Ubuntu and I've since made the leap over to Linux at work too .</p>
 	                 <p>My knowledge spans from web development, scripting and object oriented programming, to spatial/relational databases and more "traditional" GIS, like map making and spatial analysis.</p>
                   <p>I have a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/postgraduate/masters-programme/taught-masters/geographical-information-science"  >Master of Science</a> (MSc) degree, with distinction, in GIS and a <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergraduate/degrees?action=programme&code=FF68&cw_xml=index.php"  >Bachelor of Science</a> (BSc) degree in Geology and Physical Geography from the University of Edinburgh.</p>
