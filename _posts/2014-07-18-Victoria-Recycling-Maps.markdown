description:  This poster is displayed in public places and apartment buildings around Victoria. It shows nearby locations for people to recycle common household items.<p/>The concept for this map was originally from <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brucemackenzieca" >Bruce Mackenzie</a>. I have done the design and development work and Bruce has provided input and feedback throughout the project. I used a variety of open source tools to display a combination of local knowledge and data from the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/service/waste-recycling/reduce-reuse-recycle/myrecyclopedia" >Capital Region District</a> on top of <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/" >Stamen Design's</a> Watercolor basemap. The map is database driven and new versions can be rolled out when recycling facilities change.<p/>More information can be found <a href="http://joeburkinshaw.com/vicrecyclingmaps/">here</a>.
