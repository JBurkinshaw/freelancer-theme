description:  This poster is displayed in public places and apartment buildings around Victoria. It shows nearby locations where people can recycle common household items.<p/>The map was originally envisioned by <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brucemackenzieca">Bruce Mackenzie</a> and after meeting him at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Victoria-GeoGeeks/">GeoGeeks</a> Meetup, he put me in charge of the design and development side of things. I used a variety of open source tools to display a combination of local knowledge and data from the <a href="https://www.crd.bc.ca/service/waste-recycling/reduce-reuse-recycle/myrecyclopedia" >Capital Region District</a> on top of <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/" >Stamen Design</a>'s Watercolor basemap. The map is database driven and new versions can be rolled out when recycling facilities change.<p/>More information can be found <a href="http://joeburkinshaw.com/vicrecyclingmaps/">here</a>.
