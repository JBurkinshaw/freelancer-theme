description: <p>This map was created to help people get outside and explore. The aim was to replicate some of the features of the high quality and widely available UK <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/maps/explorer-map-yorkshire-dales-southern-western-area.html" target="_blank">Ordnance Survey</a> paper maps. In British Columbia it is often difficult to find topographic maps at a suitable scale that compete in terms of up to date trail and backroad information.</p><p>OpenStreetMap was the obvious choice for this map as it has extensive, crowd sourced, trail and point of interest data. Mapbox Studio was used to design the map and the styling is based on the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-studio-outdoors.tm2" target='_blank'>Mapbox Outdoors</a> style, but a number of modifications and tweaks have been made to improve its legibility as a printed map and to highlight important features for outdoor recreation. Trails have been made clearer with increased line width, brighter colours and improved labelling. Forest cover and points of interest like mountain peaks, campgrounds and pubs have been added. Names of urban areas have been given more prominence.</p>
