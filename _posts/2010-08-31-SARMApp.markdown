description: <p>SARMApp (Search and Rescue Mapping App) is a mobile web app to aid search and rescue operations in the field. It geolocates and tracks members of a ground-based search team and performs viewshed analysis on-the-fly based on digital terrain data.<p>I designed and developed the app as part of my MSc in GIS thesis project. It was developed as a mobile web app instead of a native app so it could be used on any mobile OS. While developing the application, I had to overcome and work around a number of technical challenges with the web map technology available in 2010. I have plans to reboot the project to harness modern web and mapping technologies to reduce its reliance on server side geoprocessing and map tiles (mobile data coverage can be poor in the field).<p>The research paper can be downloaded <a href="http://goo.gl/8ZEAE" >here</a>.<p>The application was awarded the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Geomatics Prize in 2010 and I subsequently wrote an article about it which was published in their <a href="http://www.rics.org/uk/news/journals/land-journal">Land Journal</a> magazine. The article is available <a href="http://goo.gl/D3CiH">here</a>.
