description: I designed and developed SARMApp (Search and Rescue Mapping App) for my MSc in GIS dissertation (thesis) project. It is a mobile web app which aids search and rescue operations in the field. It geolocates and tracks members of a ground-based search and rescue team and performs viewshed analysis on the fly.<p>While developing the application, I had to overcome a number of technical challenges with the web map technology of 2010 (or lack of). I have plans to reboot the project to harness modern web and web map technologies and reduce its reliance on server side geoprocessing and map tiles (mobile data coverage can be poor in the field).<p>The research paper can be downloaded <a href="http://goo.gl/8ZEAE" >here</a>.<p>The application was awarded the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors Geomatics Prize in 2010 and I wrote subsequently wrote an article about it for their <a href="http://www.rics.org/uk/news/journals/land-journal">Land Journal</a> magazine which is available <a href="http://goo.gl/D3CiH" >here</a>.
